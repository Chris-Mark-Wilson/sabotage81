 The objct of the game is to cause absolute mayhem in an enemy munitions dump.  
 The only issue is that its patrolled by a guard, who will shoot you on sight... line of sight that is..  

 You have a sack full of explosive charges at your disposal, but no weapon, not yet at least... maybe if you manage to takeout the guard with your shenanigans you might be able to get your hands on his...

 Once placed, a charge will begin a timed countdown, giving you enough time to escape he blast radius...  

 Dont forget though, this is a ***MUNITIONS*** yard..  
 So what do you think is going to happen when your little present reaches the end of its countdown??  

 Like I said, try not to get caught up in the blast, Paddy...

 Good Luck!
