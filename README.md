## Sabotage 81

A javascript / react port from the original [zx81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81) game by [Don Priestley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Priestley#:~:text=Don%20Priestley%20(born%201940)%20is,computers%20between%201982%20and%201989.)  

initial keys (redefinable in settings) :

 left.......Z  
 right.....X  
 up..........K  
 down.....M

 Place bomb....L  



 The object of the game is to cause absolute mayhem in an enemy munitions dump.  
 The only issue is that its patrolled by guards, ***(who will shoot you on sight... line of sight that is.)***  

 You have a sack full of explosive charges at your disposal, but no gun..

 Once placed, a charge will begin a timed countdown, giving you enough time to escape the blast radius...  

 Dont forget though, this is a ***MUNITIONS*** yard..  
 So what do you think is going to happen when your little present reaches the end of its countdown??  

 Like I said, try not to get caught up in the blast, or shot...

 Good Luck!
